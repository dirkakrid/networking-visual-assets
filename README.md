## Networking Visualization Assets
This is a collection of homebrew assets for slides and other kind of visualization aid when teaching / explaining basic networking concepts.

Everything was built through LibreOffice Calc (yes i know, sue me) and Inkscape.

The Balloon and Black Computer assets were found online and i'm almost positive they're Creative Commons. If you own them please contact me.

## Why

I occasionally do training gigs where i need to refer back to clear, colorful depictions of "boring" concepts like an IP packet and an Ethernet frame or the ISO/OSI layer.

My audience is usually entry-level computer technicians or other professional transitioning into networking and they need all the help they can get to understand these concepts in the short timeframe of a typical 4-day networking "bootcamp".
